# pypoker
This is a text based Poker game with a GUI to aid the players in navigating the game. 
This was co-written in 2017 as a final project for an introductory programming course. The code that makes up this game is relatively barebones

There are several test files included, but the pokertemplate.py file is what makes the game run
